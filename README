SparklePony

SparklePony isn't just a piece of software, it's a workflow. 
It's designed to make sharing documents and collaboration 
easier, and to make peers aware of what you are doing. The 
user interface and features are made to support this goal. 
However, you may find SparklePony useful for other kinds 
of purposes as well, like backing up files or monitoring 
your favourite project.

SparklePony currently only works on Linux, 
Windows and OSX versions are planned for the future.

What SparklePony is not:
	- A graphical frontend to git
   - A backup tool

And therefore SparklePony will not support:
	- Branching

In contrast to the projects name, we will very likely 
refuse to implement your own ponies. :)

SparklePony currently requires:
  - mono-core >= 2.0
  - git >= 1.6
  - gtk-sharp2 >= 2.12
  - notify-sharp >= 0.4.0

SparklePony is a file sharing and collaboration tool inspired by DropBox. It 
allows you to instantly sync with any Git repository you have access to.

SparklePony isn't just a piece of software, it's part of your workflow. It's 
designed to make sharing documents and collaboration easier, and to make peers 
aware of what you are doing. The user interface and features are made to 
support this goal. However, you may find SparklePony useful for other kinds of 
purposes as well, like backing up files or monitoring your favourite project.

SparklePony is not designed to be:
   - a graphical frontend for git
   - a backup tool

In contrast to the projects name, we will very likely 
refuse to implement your personal ponies. :)

SparklePony currently only works on Linux/GNOME.
Windows and OSX ports are planned for the future.
